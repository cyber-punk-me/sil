**Shadow Integration Loop**

Using AR glasses with EEG and peripheral vision feedback seems to be a promising research direction in the area of mental well-being.

The glasses would include EEG, a camera, a microphone, and multimedia playback. This way, the user's neural input and state can be captured to some degree.  
It should be possible to measure the user's repeated reactions to repeated symbols in the external world and multimedia.  
The measured reactions and symbols would blend into color-coded feedback.  
This feedback would be displayed in the peripheral vision area.  
This setup helps the user better realize their reactions to repeated symbols or situations (sequences of symbols).  
By doing different activities and matching them with music or other media, the user can gradually attain a higher degree of self-reflection.
